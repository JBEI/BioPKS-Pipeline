    "Users need to specify the following input parameters when attempting to synthesize a molecule *in silico* with BioPKS Pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pathway sequence`: this can be either of the lists `['pks']` or `['pks', 'bio']` and it determines if only PKSs should be used to synthesize a target molecule, or if post-PKS modifications should be allowed as well. The goal of BioPKS Pipeline is to expand the chemical space accessible by merging PKSs and regular, monofunctional enzymes in biology, so it is likely that using both types of enzymes will result in a higher chance of reaching one's target chemical than using either alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "`target_smiles`: the SMILES string of the desired target chemical. Regardless of whether the input SMILES string contains stereochemical information about a molecule or not, BioPKS Pipeline will automatically convert the input SMILES to its canonical form and remove any chirality. This is because in this work, we have focused only on getting the correct 2D structure of a target molecule rather than its 3D structure. We anticipate future releases of our tool to be able to achieve the correct 3D structure of a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "`target_name`: the name of the input target. This will be used to save BioPKS Pipeline's results in the folder `data/results_logs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pks_release_mechanism`: the offloading reaction with which to release the PKS product from RetroTide. Users have two options here - they can either select between `thiolysis` or `cyclization`. A `thiolysis` reaction will form a carboxylic acid while a `cyclization` reaction will form a lactone. There are several other termination reactions catalyzed by uniqe thioesterase (TE) domains but we've only included `thiolysis` and `cyclization` here since these are the most common anyway."

    "`pks_starters_filepath`: list of PKS starter units available to RetroTide (default: `../biopks_pipeline/retrotide/data/starters.smi`).\n",

This is the list that users can edit to control which starting acyl-CoA derivatives can be used when designing synthesis pathways for small-molecules. In our manuscript, for non-aromatic molecules, we constrained the list of starter units to only malonyl-CoA (\"mal\"), methylmalonyl-CoA (\"mmal\"), methoxymalonyl-CoA (\"mxmal\"), hydroxymalonyl-CoA (\"hmal\"), and allylmalonyl-CoA (\"allylmal\"). This list of starter units can be written as: `[\"mal\", \"mmal\", \"mxmal\", \"hmal\", \"allylmal\"]`. For non-aromatic molecules, however, we allowed all starter units to be used by BioPKS Pipeline. This can be enabled by simply writing \"all\" for this field in `pks_starters`. For this tutorial, we will use the 5 malonyl-CoA type starter units mentioned above.\n",

In our manuscript, for non-aromatic molecules, we constrained the list of extender units to only malonyl-CoA (\"mal\"), methylmalonyl-CoA (\"mmal\"), methoxymalonyl-CoA (\"mxmal\"), hydroxymalonyl-CoA (\"hmal\"), and allylmalonyl-CoA (\"allylmal\").

    "`pks_similarity_metric`: chemical similarity metric to use for ranking RetroTide's PKS products. We recommend using `mcs_without_stereo`, which prioritizes the maximum common substructure (MCS) between an intermediate PKS molecule and the final, target product. In performing this comparison, we ignore any stereochemical considerations. Other options include `atompairs` and `atomatompath`. Users are also welcome to add their own chemical similarity metrics of interest in `biopks_pipeline/retrotide/retrotide.py`.\n",

    "`non_pks_similarity_metric`: chemical similarity metric to use for ranking DORAnet's post-PKS products. We also recommend using `mcs_without_stereo` here. This metric enables BioPKS Pipeline to retrieve the most chemically similar post-PKS product with respect to the target chemical in the event that the final target is not reached.\n",

    "`non_pks_steps`: number of non-PKS steps to modify PKS products for.\n",

    "`non_pks_cores`: number of computing cores used by DORAnet when searching for pathways after reaction networks have been generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "`bio_max_atoms`: the maximum number of atoms that are allowed by DORAnet. This is a filter and users can specify upper-bounds for the number of each atom of each type that should be allowed. For instance, to limit both the number of carbon atoms and the number of nitrogen atoms, users can enter a dictionary such as: {\"C\":\"6\", \"N\":\"2\"}. To not use this filter at all, however, users can simply specify `\"None\"`."
